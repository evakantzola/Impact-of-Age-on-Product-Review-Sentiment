# Impact-of-Age-on-Product-Review-Sentiment
###### Sentiment Analysis and Classification of product reviews and the impact of age on it


The project is divided in two parts:

- Sentiment CLassification of online product reviews using supervised machine learning techniques
  - Experimenting with different types of feature sets 
    - Text Features ( N-grams )
    - Combination of Text and Age features
    
- Examine the relation between the age (of the reviewer) and the sentiment (expressed in the review)
  - Find out whether the age can affect the sentiment classification
